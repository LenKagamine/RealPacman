# RealPacman

A Pacman clone written in Java with a slight twist...

Pacman now follows your mouse and _ghosts can move through walls_.

- Use your mouse to guide Pacman
- Ghosts will follow more accurately the closer it is to Pacman
- Click anywhere on the screen when Pacman walks onto a cherry to eat it
- The more cherries eaten, the faster Pacman and the ghosts move

How long can you last until the ghosts catch up?
